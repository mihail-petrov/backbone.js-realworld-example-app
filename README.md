# (WIP)

> ### Backone.js codebase containing real world examples of the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

This repo is work in progress.

### [Demo]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

Backbone.js is one of the first javascript libraries that brouth the arcitecture inside the front end application. It ia a minimal aproche for organasing your application. No complex logic, no stragnge syntax no in your face best practises, just you and your code. In this example I am going to develop the realworld application using only backbone.js and its hard dependancies jQuery and underscore.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

## Application Libraries
- Backoben.js 1.3.3
- jQuery 1.12.4
- Underscore 1.8.3

## Build script

## Virtual container
The applica is shiped and distributed usingvirtual container Vagrant for convinins. The vagrant is not nesesary in order to run the application. But in this section I am going to describe how to set up the local Vagrant environment.

* TODO
